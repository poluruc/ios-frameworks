### Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0
1. **Update Xcode** to 16.0 or later
2. **Update iOS deployment target** to 14.0 minimum
3. **Update Swift language version** to 6.0
4. **Replace framework binaries** with new versions
5. **Clean build folder** and rebuild project
6. **Test Swift 6 concurrency** compliance if using strict checking

#### Compatibility Notes
- Projects targeting iOS 13.x should remain on v1.x until ready to upgrade
- Swift 5.x projects require migration to Swift 6.0
- Legacy Objective-C projects may need additional configuration

## Migration Notes

### From Source Dependencies
If migrating from source-based dependencies (CocoaPods, Carthage, SPM):

1. Remove existing dependency declarations
2. Clean build folder completely
3. Add prebuilt frameworks following integration guide
4. Update import statements if necessary
5. Test thoroughly on both device and simulator

### Build Time Improvements
Users typically see these improvements after switching to prebuilt frameworks:

- **Clean builds**: 60-80% reduction in build time
- **Incremental builds**: 50-70% faster compilation
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Significant reduction in compute minutes
