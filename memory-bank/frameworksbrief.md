# iOS Prebuilt Frameworks Repository Brief

## Project Overview
This repository contains prebuilt iOS framework binaries designed to dramatically reduce compilation time for iOS Swift projects. By providing pre-compiled XCFrameworks, developers can skip the lengthy framework compilation process during clean builds.

## Core Purpose
- **Build Time Optimization**: Reduce iOS project compilation time by 60-80%
- **Developer Productivity**: Enable faster iteration cycles during development
- **CI/CD Efficiency**: Minimize continuous integration build times and compute costs
- **Team Consistency**: Ensure all developers use identical framework versions

## Target Audience
- iOS developers using Swift 6.0+ and Xcode 16.0+
- Development teams looking to optimize build performance
- CI/CD pipelines requiring faster build times
- Projects using popular iOS frameworks (Alamofire, Realm, Kingfisher, etc.)
- Teams adopting iOS 26 and modern Swift concurrency features

## Key Requirements
- iOS 14.0+ deployment target compatibility (iOS 26 fully supported)
- Universal XCFramework format supporting all iOS architectures
- Swift 6.0 and strict concurrency compliance
- Proper code signing for both development and distribution
- Privacy manifest compliance for App Store submissions
- Git LFS support for efficient binary file management

## Success Metrics
- Build time reduction: 60-80% for clean builds
- Developer satisfaction: Faster development cycles
- CI/CD efficiency: Reduced compute minutes and costs
- Adoption rate: Easy integration into existing projects

## Repository Scope
**Included:**
- Pre-compiled XCFramework binaries
- Integration documentation and guides
- Version compatibility matrices
- Troubleshooting resources
- Git LFS configuration for binary management

**Excluded:**
- Framework source code (maintained in upstream repositories)
- Custom framework modifications
- Framework compilation scripts
- Development environment setup beyond integration

## Framework Selection Criteria
Frameworks included in this repository meet these requirements:
- **Popularity**: Widely used in iOS development community
- **Stability**: Mature APIs with regular maintenance
- **Compatibility**: Support for current iOS and Xcode versions
- **License**: Open-source licenses compatible with binary distribution
- **Size**: Reasonable binary size for Git repository management
